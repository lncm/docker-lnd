This repo builds [`lnd`] in a completely reproducible, and auditable way, and packages it into radically minimal Docker containers provided for various CPU architectures and in various variants.

[`lnd`]: https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd

#### Details

* **All [`git-tags`]** <small>(and most commits)</small> **are signed** by `D8CA1776EB9265491D07CE67F546ECBEA809CB18` 
* **All [`git-tags`]** <small>(and most commits)</small> **are [`opentimestamps`]-ed**
* **All builds are fully reproducible.**  Each `Dockerfile` builds `lnd` twice: once on [Alpine], and once on [Debian], and the result binaries are [compared against each other] before proceeding
* Each build produces binaries for: `amd64`, `arm64v8`, `arm32v7`, and `arm32v6`
* Some Docker Images are also provided in different variants, ex: `monitoring` (enables Prometheus monitoring), or `experimental` (enables options disabled by default)  
* All architectures are aggregated under an easy-to-use [Docker Manifest]
* All [`git-tags`] are [build automatically], and with an [auditable trace]
* Each successful build of a `git tag` pushes result Docker image to [Docker Hub]
* Each successful build of a `git tag` uploads result Go binaries to [Github Releases]
* Images pushed to Docker Hub are never deleted (even if `lnd` version gets overriden, previous one is preserved)
* All `final` images are based on Alpine for minimum base size
* All binaries are [compressed with `upx`]
* Each `git-tag` build is tagged with a unique tag number
* Each _minor_ version is stored in a separate directory (for the ease of backporting patches)

## Usage

### Pull

First pull the image from [Docker Hub]:

```bash
docker pull lncm/lnd:v0.9.0
```

> **NOTE:** Running above will automatically choose native architecture of your CPU.

[Docker Hub]: https://hub.docker.com/r/lncm/lnd

Or, to pull a specific CPU architecture:

```bash
docker pull lncm/lnd:v0.9.0-arm64
```

#### Start

Then to start lnd, execute:

```bash
docker run  -it  --rm  --detach \
    -v ~/.lnd:/data/.lnd \
    -p 9735:9735 \
    -p 10009:10009 \
    --name lnd \
    lncm/lnd:v0.9.0
```

That will runs `lnd` with:

* all data generated by the container is stored in `~/.lnd` **on your host machine**,
* all data is created as owned by used with `UID` `1000`
* port `9735` is reachable on the localhost for the peer-to-peer communication,
* port `10009` is reachable on the localhost for RPC communication,
* created container will get named `lnd`,
* that command will run the container in the background and print the ID of the container being run.


#### Interact

To issue any commands to a running container, do:

```bash
docker exec -it lnd BINARY COMMAND
```

Where:
* `BINARY` is either `lnd` or `lncli`, and
* `COMMAND` is something you'd normally pass to the binary   

Examples:

```bash
docker exec -it lnd  lnd --help
docker exec -it lnd  lnd --version
docker exec -it lnd  lncli --help
docker exec -it lnd  lncli getinfo
docker exec -it lnd  lncli getnetworkinfo
```


## Releases

After `git-tag` push, the release process is fully automated.  That being said there are a few things that need to be done to prepare for the release.

### Patch Release 

In case of a patch release (v0.0.X), it's enough to edit `VERSION` variable in appropriate `Dockerfile`, commit, and run `./scripts/new-release.sh …`.

Ex. If `lnd` gets updated from `v0.6.0-beta` to `v0.6.1-beta`, it's _usually_ enough to open `0.6/Dockerfile`, update [this line] with the new tag, commit, and run:

```shell script
./scripts/new-release.sh v0.6.1
```

> **NOTE:** The `new-release.sh` scripts ensures that correct version is set in the relevant `Dockerfile`, as well as that correct build tag is used.

### Major/Minor release

This releases might bring changes that are not backwards compatible.  To have separation, it's recommended to create `MAJOR.MINOR/` directory at repo's root, copy `Dockerfile` from the previous version, and follow the steps described in [Patch Release].

One additional thing to be done here, is adding a new entry to `matrix.ver` in [`test.yml`] file to make sure that newly added version is being tested.

[`test.yml`]: https://github.com/lncm/docker-lnd/blob/c0f8ee34cab1f39c92e3ef31a7c70ce63b8e2ba9/.github/workflows/test.yml#L21-L26

[Patch Release]: #Patch-Release 

### Trigger

To trigger build of new-multi arch release, run `./scripts/new-release.sh …`.  After a few minutes the new version should show up on Docker Hub.
